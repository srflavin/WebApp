Since then, hundreds of thousands of people have registered .app domains, and we want to take a moment to celebrate them.  </p><p>People are making more websites and apps than ever before. A <a href="https://safe.page/survey">recent survey</a> we conducted with The Harris Poll found that nearly half (48 percent) of U.S. respondents plan to create a website in the near future. And a lot of people, especially students, are already building on the web. Over a third (34 percent) of 16-24 year olds who’ve already created a website did so for a class project. </p><p>Having a meaningful domain name helps students turn their projects into reality. Take Ludwik Trammer, creator of <a href="https://shrew.app/">shrew.app</a>, who said: “The site started as a project for my graduate Educational Technology class at Georgia Tech. Getting the perfect domain gave me the initial push to turn it into the real deal (instead of making a prototype, publishing a scientific paper on it, and forgetting it).”</p><h2>Helping creators launch their sites securely</h2><p>With so many new creators, it’s essential that everyone does their part to <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/tips-from-google-to-stay-safe-while-browsing-the-internet/">make the internet safer</a>. That’s why <a href="https://www.registry.google/">Google Registry designed .app</a> to be secure by default, meaning every website on .app requires a HTTPS connection to ensure a secure connection to the internet.</p><p></p><p>HTTPS helps keep you and your website visitors safe from bad actors, who may exploit connections that aren’t secure by:</p><ul><li><p>intercepting or altering the site’s content</p></li><li><p>misdirecting traffic</p></li><li><p>spying on open Wi-Fi networks</p></li><li><p>injecting ad malware or tracking</p></li></ul></div>
